Done 
* âœ… completed [project setup](https://graphite.rs/volunteer/guide/project-setup/), graphite runs locally

I want to see the "documents as programs" perspective and run a simple Graphite doc.  From `master` branch I tried:

```bash
cargo run --package graphene-cli run document.graphite
cargo run --package graphene-cli compile document.graphite
```

But received some errors related to `winit`:

```rust
thread 'main' panicked at node-graph/graph-craft/src/wasm_application_io.rs:233:9:
not yet implemented: winit api changed, calling create_window on EventLoop is deprecated
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

It looks like this part of the code is in-progress so I tried the `latest-stable` tag.  

```bash
cargo run --package graphene-cli compile document.graphite
```

```
thread 'main' panicked at node-graph/graph-craft/src/util.rs:8:52:
Failed to parse document: Error("missing field `lambda`", line: 1, column: 69)
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

After some investigation I think the `lambda` field was present in older `.graphite` formats but not in more recent ones.  So I switched back to `master`.


# Current Goals

* If a `Node` is just an ordinary rust function, I should try implementing my own node
* Use Graphite to recreate the cutting template for my [game token stickers](https://benrbray.com/blog/dnd-character-tokens) originally made with Typst
